## Step 3: Triggering Lambda with S3 Events

We have configured an S3 event to trigger the Lambda function when a file is uploaded. Let's try it out!


This will show you the log output from the Lambda function's execution. ***click***

```
echo "This is a test file" > test.txt
awslocal s3 cp test.txt s3://my-devops-tutorial-bucket/test.txt
```{{exec}}

The Lambda function should now be triggered by the file upload.

Letâ€™s confirm that the Lambda function was executed by checking the log streams. Run the command below to list the log streams for the Lambda function. ***click***

```bash
awslocal logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name /aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction
```{{exec}}

This will return a list of log streams. Look for the log stream that matches the invocation time.

***click*** to view the logs of our lambda function. If we see *"Hello from Lambda!"*, we've set it up correctly. 

```bash
LOG_STREAM_NAME=$(awslocal logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name /aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction --query 'logStreams[0].logStreamName' --output text)

awslocal logs get-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction --log-stream-name "$LOG_STREAM_NAME"

```{{exec}}
