## Step 3: Triggering Lambda with S3 Events

We have configured an S3 event to trigger the Lambda function when a file is uploaded. Let's try it out!


This will show you the log output from the Lambda function's execution.

```
echo "This is a test file" > test.txt
awslocal s3 cp test.txt s3://my-devops-tutorial-bucket/test.txt
```{{exec}}

The Lambda function should now be triggered by the file upload.

Letâ€™s confirm that the Lambda function was executed by checking the log streams. Run the command below to list the log streams for the Lambda function:

```bash
awslocal logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name /aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction
```{{exec}}

This will return a list of log streams. Look for the log stream that matches the invocation time.

Once you have the log stream name, replace `<log-stream-name>` in the following command and execute it to view the logs:

```bash
awslocal logs get-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/myLambdaFunction --log-stream-name <log-stream-name>
```
